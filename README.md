## Goal 

Currently the services landscape for newcomers who are in Canada & are about to enter Canada are fragmented and tough to navigate, leaving newcomers confused as to which process would aid them in integration in the most efficient manner. This project aims to centralize all existing services in Montreal in one location, as well as provide newcomers with their own customizable dashboard to track, schedule, review, and discover new services with the aid of our built in chatbot. Lastly we track the most in-demand requests for services and the most successful paths of integration to create better suggestions in terms of quality & efficiency for future newcomers looking to integrate before or after they arrive.
