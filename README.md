## Goal 

MigrantHub is a Social network application geared at international students, immigrants, refugees, and prospective refugees. A user can create a profile and join communities that he or she is interested in. They can also register for services that will be integrated into the application. These services can be provided by both governmental and non-governmental organizations to help migrants. The application will gather user data about the services used by the migrants. This will include questions they need answers to or specific services that are most helpful to them. The data will be used to provide migrants with better choices.
